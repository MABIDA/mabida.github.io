The Massachusetts Branch of the International Dyslexia Association (MABIDA) was formed to increase public awareness of dyslexia in Massachusetts, to encourage teacher training in effective methods for individuals with dyslexia, and to support research in dyslexia. Western Massachusetts is a region within our branch.

Since 1971 we have served individuals with dyslexia, their families and professionals in the field in Massachusetts. Many of our 500 members are actively involved in the study and treatment of dyslexia. Our members are educators, psychologists, physicians, speech/language therapists, individuals with dyslexia and parents. [Please join us!](/pages/members)

To meet our objectives, we sponsor both professional development seminars throughout the year and a full day conference in the spring. These programs are designed to provide educators, speech/language therapists, parents and other interested individuals with the latest information regarding dyslexia and related topics. MABIDA also runs parent round tables throughout the year for parents and individuals with dyslexia. We also offer scholarships to help teachers obtain training in multisensory structured language education (MSLE) for teaching students with dyslexia.

Information about resources in Massachusetts, including testing, tutoring and scheduled events, can be obtained by calling MABIDA at 617-650-0011 or by sending an email to MassBranchIDA@gmail.com.
