The International Dyslexia Association (Association) and the Massachusetts Branch of the International Dyslexia Association (MABIDA) support efforts to provide individuals with dyslexia with appropriate instruction and to identify these individuals at an early age.

The Association and MABIDA believe that multisensory structured language teaching is the best approach currently available for those affected by dyslexia. The Association and MABIDA, however, do not endorse any specific program, speaker or instructional materials, noting that there are a number that present the critical components of instruction as defined by current standards of research-based evidence on reading as specified by the Department of Education 2003 and the National Reading Panel (NRP) 2003.
