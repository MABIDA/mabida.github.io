# notes about this site.

The site's settings are in _config.yml. Make sure they're accurate.

### contact form

https://getsimpleform.com/instructions?api_token=b4e76ab721990ee8726b3986f651645c

 Using simpleform - ie getsimpleform.com. Note the API token? It's set, customized, in the _config.yml.
 I've set it up to email massbranchida@gmail.com. If you want to change it, go back to http://getsimpleform.com and generate a new one - get a new API token and replace it in _config.yml. This means restarting the jekyll site and sending the new pages up to the server.


 ## remaining things to do

 Favicons, Google Analytics. Once the site is in a github repository, and i have been granted access to it, ill go in and set it up. Will need Joanna to set up Google analytics first.
